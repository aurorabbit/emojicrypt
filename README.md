# emojicrypt v0

This was the first working prototype of emojicrypt.

It is wraught with errors, and will not be supported, or carried forward as a protocol version.

This is in order to extend the protocol header from 1 byte to 2 bytes, in order to support ASCII-only encoding, optional case-sensitive passwords, and variable length HMACs.
